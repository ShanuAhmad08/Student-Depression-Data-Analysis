# Student-Depression-Data-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a student mental health dataset to explore key factors influencing student depression levels. The analysis was conducted using SQL Server for data preparation and Tableau for visualization.
Data Preparation: Imported the dataset into SQL Server, cleaned data, modified columns (gender, age group, depression index), and added necessary calculated fields.

Data Analysis: Used SQL to analyze distribution patterns and categorized students based on stress factors like academic pressure, study hours, and sleep duration.

Visualization: Connected the cleaned data to Tableau Desktop and created interactive charts and graphs showing student count trends across multiple factors.

Dashboard & Publishing: Built a summary dashboard and published the final report to Tableau Cloud for easy sharing and access.

Tools: SQL Server, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Cloud
Skills: Data Cleaning, SQL, Data Analysis, Visualization, Dashboarding
